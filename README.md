# IrisAuth-ScoreAggregation-FHE-



This work enhances a privacy-preserving iris authentication framework that employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure end-to-end security of biometric data. The baseline system utilizes CNN-based feature extraction, autoencoder-based compression, and CKKS encryption to enable secure similarity computation without revealing sensitive information. To improve verification reliability, the proposed system introduces Score-Level Aggregation, allowing multiple iris samples captured during authentication to be compared homomorphically. Instead of relying on a single input, the system generates encrypted similarity or distance scores for each sample and aggregates them using encrypted averaging, weighted sum, or median operations. These aggregation computations occur entirely on ciphertexts, preserving privacy throughout the process, while decryption and final decision-making remain client-side. The aggregation-based approach enhances robustness against noise caused by blinking, eye movement, and lighting variations, leading to improved accuracy over single-sample verification. Overall, the proposed method offers a practical and scalable enhancement for secure biometric authentication in sensitive environments.
